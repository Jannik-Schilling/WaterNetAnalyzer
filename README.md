# WaterNetPlugin
....is a QGIS3 plugin to create a water network (sewer network, river network) from a line layer (shapefile). So far the plugin provides three tools. 

The first one adds information about connections in the network to the attribute table. You just have to select the undermost line segment (e.g. in a sewage system it´s the last one before entering a treatment plant, in a river system it´s the river mouth) and click on "Run".
